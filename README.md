===================
*Develop by* [**Phuong Duong**](https://phuongduongsite.wordpress.com/about/)


Overview
-------------
Today, data is growing rapidly around us. That's the raw data and does not have a connection with each other. So how to we can discover the fun hidden behind each Terabyte of data. Therefore, this'is the reason to **DataMining Toolkit** was born.

**DataMining Toolkit** is a product with the friendly UI (User Interface) and convenient for the user to explore the data. Data will be stored in different file formats such as ** .csv, * .libsvm*. Applications will open the data file and explore the characteristic quantities of the way as *Expected, Variance, Standard Deviation, Mode, Median, The Quartiles (Quartile), Max, Min, Range, Interquartile Range* . 

With each dimensional to visualize it, this application can be able to draw the *Histogram charts, Box plot charts, Quantile plot charts, Quantile-Quantile plot charts*. In addition, users can select arbitrary two-dimensional and application can be able to project two-dimensional data and display these data projector.
